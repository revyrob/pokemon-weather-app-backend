## Pokemon Weather Application - Server

A one-page mobile phone pokemon weather application built for a 5 hour hackathon with <a href="https://github.com/kai0716">Kevin</a>.  

Search for the suggested pokemon, while receiving the weather, and depending on the weather a variety of mocktails are given to enjoy after the search.  

The application back-end was built with Express and Node and we implement our own APIs and those from Weatherbit.

# To Run Application

npm start

You will find the frontend in revyrob's repos under <a href="https://github.com/revyrob/pokemon-weather-app-frontend">pokemon-weather-client</a>.
